(CMD for Windows ,SHELL/TERMINAL for Unix/Mac/Linux) so the players will
select the cell where they want to move from and the cell where they
want to move to for example they'll first choose (a2) and then (a4) to
move the pawn from a2 to a4 .

-As the game will not widely support colors so the names of the players
will be (P1,P2) and it will be on the cell within each player piece
(King,Queen,Pawn.....) .
